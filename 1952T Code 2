You feel so lost, all this time spent trying to save this constantly deteriorating situation. Part of you is relieved the job is over, if anyone else but that bastard was taking over for you. You let out a deep sigh, and take another sip of your scotch.<br><br>Douglas MacArthur’s term will be transformatory for the country. The New Deal will never be the same again. McCarthy will be fully unleashed, sending the nation into mass panic and hysteria. Your progress abroad will be undone, and Mac’s actions in Asia may even spark war between the world’s foremost powers.<br><br>For now, Mr. Truman, you return to Missouri in disgrace.", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>r/presidents: Looking Back on Harry Truman - u/kennedyremedy12</h3><p>0 Upvotes<br><br>Harry Truman is generally ranked in the middle tier of presidents. But is he really so mediocre? He’s gained a reputation for incompetency, but I personally believe he accomplished some great things while in office and should’ve been elected for a third term.<br><br>His foreign policy was a precursor of Reagan, Bush, Kennedy, and nearly every other President of that era, after all, he started the Cold War. And really, you people love Kennedy but hate Truman, who was just like Kennedy but wasn't assassinated. The New Frontier was just a new version of Truman's Fair Deal. The Cuban Missile Crisis was just Kennedy's version of everything that Truman must have handled.<br><br>I hate when people underestimate Truman. He basically founded Cold War America.<br><br>Comments:<br><br>NixonFan23:What are we talking about? He was just a pathetic President. I'm kinda sad for him. You know, he became President by accident, won in 1948 by accident, and when the American people realized that he was, well, a failure, they just rejected him. But I'm not sad for him. He was more corrupt than any other President, and nobody did anything about it.</p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>MACARTHUR IMPEACHED AFTER NUCLEAR STRIKE IN KOREA</h3><p>The MacArthur presidency has seen its greatest twist yet: impeachment! In the latest move by House Democrats against the general, Articles of Impeachment have been drafted and ratified in the House. While the senate is unlikely to convict MacArthur, mainly due to Dixiecrats crossing over to support the president, this is a massive blow to his administration. <br><br>The move comes in response to MacArthur’s decision to deploy a nuclear weapon in Korea, meant to force Chinese troops into pulling out of the north. This was met with shock and horror from across the country, with some areas in the North seeing massive protests.<br><br>House Leader John W. McCormack called the action “grossly irresponsible” and has said that MacArthur should “face consequences.”</p>", "<FONT COLOR=“000000”><h3>MACARTHUR IMPEACHED AFTER NUCLEAR STRIKE IN KOREA</h3>The MacArthur presidency has seen its greatest twist yet: impeachment!
